    description: "For this project, I used React, Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS to build a responsive, SEO-friendly portfolio website. I leveraged React for dynamic content rendering and Next.js for optimized server-side rendering. The design features a clean, user-friendly interface styled with Tailwind CSS. I also implemented a functional contact form using the Resend email API with secure environment variables for API key management, demonstrating both third-party API integration and security best practices.",

    description: "I led a 4-member team to develop a full-stack AI-powered fast food chatbot for In-N-Out using Flask and spaCy, managing project planning and team coordination via Jira and Confluence. We used a Kanban board to ensure timely feature delivery. I applied ML-based NLP techniques with spaCy to process customer inquiries, enabling understanding of menu items, prices, and orders. I also built a dynamic menu system from a CSV file and designed a user-friendly web interface for seamless front-end and back-end integration.",
